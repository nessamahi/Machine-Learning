**Topic 2: Outbreak Investigation**

+ Read DNA sequences from FASTA file with Biopython package. 
+ Apply Hamming Distance method to calculate pairwise distance.
+ Prjoect the sequence in 2D space using Multidimention Scaling.
+ Plot the 2D data points.
+ Use K-means clustering.  

**Topic 2: Use Linear Regression to Predict Covid-19 Mortality in the Countries Worldwide**
  Two Features :
  + Percentage of persons over the age of 65 in the population
  + The number of hospital beds per 1000 people in the most recent reported year.
The response variable for each country will be the number of Covid-19 deaths per 100k population. To train the model, use the from 10 countries
of (your) choice [excluding USA]. Then apply the trained model to predict the number of deaths per 100k persons in the USA.
